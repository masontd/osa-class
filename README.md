Our project is the perfect tool to control any mood lighting!

Once the `recognize.py` script is running, the assistant will wake up on the command "hello raspberry."

Then, until told to "stop," the assistant will attempt to recognize any colors it is told: "red," "blue," "green," "yellow," "purple," or "clear" (clear is effectively off).

Once told to stop, the assistant will turn off until `recognize.py` is run again.
